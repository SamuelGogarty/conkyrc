The coretemp scripts are meant to provide the temperatures of your first 2 cores using the "coretemp" driver.
See the manual of coretemp for more info about that.
Put "coretemp_enable="YES" in your /boot/loader.conf file.
Make both the coretemp scripts executable with:
"chmod +x .conky-temp-core1"
"chmod +x .conky-temp-core2"
